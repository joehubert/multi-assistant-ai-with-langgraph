# Chapter 12: Advanced Patterns and Extensions

> "The greatest scientists are artists as well." â€” Albert Einstein

The research assistant implementation we've explored provides a solid foundation, but there are numerous ways to extend and enhance it for different use cases. This chapter explores advanced patterns and potential extensions that can take our implementation to the next level.

## Adding More Analyst Types

The current implementation generates analyst personas based on themes in the research topic, but we can extend this to include predefined analyst types for specific domains.

### Domain-Specific Analysts

For specialized research domains, we could define domain-specific analyst types:

```python
class BusinessAnalyst(Analyst):
    financial_focus: str = Field(
        description="Specific financial or business aspects the analyst focuses on."
    )
    market_expertise: List[str] = Field(
        description="Markets or industries the analyst has expertise in."
    )

class TechnicalAnalyst(Analyst):
    technical_domains: List[str] = Field(
        description="Technical domains the analyst specializes in."
    )
    implementation_experience: str = Field(
        description="The analyst's experience with practical implementations."
    )
```

These specialized analyst types would extend the base `Analyst` class with domain-specific fields.

### Mixed Analyst Generation

We could modify the analyst generation to include a mix of general and specialized analysts:

```python
def create_mixed_analysts(state: GenerateAnalystsState):
    """ Create a mix of general and specialized analysts """
    
    topic = state['topic']
    max_analysts = state['max_analysts']
    human_analyst_feedback = state.get('human_analyst_feedback', '')
    
    # Determine how many of each type based on the topic
    # ...
    
    # Generate general analysts
    general_analysts = generate_general_analysts(topic, num_general)
    
    # Generate specialized analysts based on domain
    specialized_analysts = generate_specialized_analysts(topic, domain, num_specialized)
    
    # Combine and return
    return {"analysts": general_analysts + specialized_analysts}
```

This approach would ensure that research includes both general perspectives and specialized domain expertise.

### User-Defined Analysts

We could also allow users to define custom analysts:

```python
def add_user_defined_analyst(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Add a user-defined analyst to the set """
    
    # Get existing analysts
    analysts = state.get("analysts", [])
    
    # Get user-defined analyst
    user_analyst = state.get("user_analyst", None)
    
    if user_analyst:
        # Validate user analyst against schema
        # ...
        
        # Add to analysts
        analysts.append(user_analyst)
    
    return {"analysts": analysts}
```

This function would allow users to inject their own custom analysts into the research process, bringing specific perspectives that might not be generated automatically.

## Extending the Search Capabilities

The current implementation uses Tavily Search and Wikipedia for information retrieval, but we can extend this with additional sources and enhanced search capabilities.

### Specialized Database Integration

For domain-specific research, we could integrate specialized databases:

```python
def search_academic_databases(state: InterviewState):
    """ Retrieve docs from academic databases """

    # Search query
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)
    search_query = structured_llm.invoke([search_instructions]+state['messages'])
    
    # Search academic databases
    search_docs = AcademicDatabaseLoader(
        query=search_query.search_query,
        databases=["arxiv", "pubmed", "semantic_scholar"],
        max_results=3
    ).load()

     # Format
    formatted_search_docs = "\n\n---\n\n".join(
        [
            f'<Document source="{doc.metadata["source"]}" authors="{doc.metadata.get("authors", "")}" year="{doc.metadata.get("year", "")}"/>\n{doc.page_content}\n</Document>'
            for doc in search_docs
        ]
    )

    return {"context": [formatted_search_docs]} 
```

This function would search academic databases for scholarly information, enhancing the research with peer-reviewed content.

### Local Knowledge Base Search

For enterprise applications, we could integrate search against local knowledge bases:

```python
def search_enterprise_kb(state: InterviewState):
    """ Retrieve docs from enterprise knowledge base """

    # Search query
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)
    search_query = structured_llm.invoke([search_instructions]+state['messages'])
    
    # Search enterprise knowledge base
    search_docs = EnterpriseKBLoader(
        query=search_query.search_query,
        repositories=["policies", "procedures", "reports"],
        max_results=3
    ).load()

     # Format
    formatted_search_docs = "\n\n---\n\n".join(
        [
            f'<Document path="{doc.metadata["path"]}" department="{doc.metadata.get("department", "")}" date="{doc.metadata.get("date", "")}"/>\n{doc.page_content}\n</Document>'
            for doc in search_docs
        ]
    )

    return {"context": [formatted_search_docs]} 
```

This function would search enterprise knowledge bases for internal information, making the research assistant valuable for organizational research.

### Semantic Search Enhancements

We could enhance the search process with semantic search capabilities:

```python
def semantic_search(state: InterviewState):
    """ Retrieve docs using semantic search """

    # Search query
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)
    search_query = structured_llm.invoke([search_instructions]+state['messages'])
    
    # Generate embeddings for the query
    query_embedding = embedding_model.embed_query(search_query.search_query)
    
    # Search vector database
    search_docs = vector_db.similarity_search_by_vector(
        query_embedding,
        k=3
    )

     # Format
    formatted_search_docs = "\n\n---\n\n".join(
        [
            f'<Document id="{doc.metadata["id"]}" similarity="{doc.metadata.get("score", "")}"/>\n{doc.page_content}\n</Document>'
            for doc in search_docs
        ]
    )

    return {"context": [formatted_search_docs]} 
```

This function would use embeddings and vector search to find semantically similar documents, potentially uncovering connections that keyword search might miss.

## Implementing Additional Sources

Beyond search, we can integrate additional information sources to enhance the research process.

### Data Analysis Integration

For research involving data, we could integrate data analysis capabilities:

```python
def analyze_data(state: InterviewState):
    """ Analyze data relevant to the research topic """

    # Extract key terms from the conversation
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(DataQuery)
    data_query = structured_llm.invoke([data_instructions]+state['messages'])
    
    # Retrieve relevant datasets
    datasets = dataset_registry.get_datasets(data_query.keywords)
    
    # Analyze datasets
    analysis_results = []
    for dataset in datasets:
        analysis = DataAnalyzer(dataset).analyze(data_query.analysis_type)
        analysis_results.append(analysis)

    # Format
    formatted_analysis = "\n\n---\n\n".join(
        [
            f'<Analysis dataset="{result.dataset_name}" type="{result.analysis_type}"/>\n{result.summary}\n{result.visualization_description}\n</Analysis>'
            for result in analysis_results
        ]
    )

    return {"context": [formatted_analysis]} 
```

This function would retrieve and analyze relevant datasets, incorporating data-driven insights into the research process.

### Expert Simulation Enhancement

We could enhance the expert simulation with more sophisticated knowledge retrieval:

```python
def retrieve_expert_knowledge(state: InterviewState):
    """ Retrieve specialized expert knowledge """

    # Identify the expertise needed based on the question
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(ExpertiseQuery)
    expertise_query = structured_llm.invoke([expertise_instructions]+state['messages'])
    
    # Retrieve expert knowledge
    expert_knowledge = knowledge_base.query_expertise(
        domain=expertise_query.domain,
        subtopics=expertise_query.subtopics,
        depth=expertise_query.depth
    )

    # Format
    formatted_knowledge = "\n\n---\n\n".join(
        [
            f'<ExpertKnowledge domain="{knowledge.domain}" confidence="{knowledge.confidence}"/>\n{knowledge.content}\n</ExpertKnowledge>'
            for knowledge in expert_knowledge
        ]
    )

    return {"context": [formatted_knowledge]} 
```

This function would retrieve specialized expert knowledge from a knowledge base, enhancing the expert's responses with deep domain expertise.

### Real-Time Data Integration

For research on current topics, we could integrate real-time data sources:

```python
def retrieve_real_time_data(state: InterviewState):
    """ Retrieve real-time data relevant to the topic """

    # Identify real-time data needs
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(RealTimeDataQuery)
    data_query = structured_llm.invoke([real_time_instructions]+state['messages'])
    
    # Retrieve real-time data
    real_time_data = data_service.query(
        data_types=data_query.data_types,
        timeframe=data_query.timeframe,
        entities=data_query.entities
    )

    # Format
    formatted_data = "\n\n---\n\n".join(
        [
            f'<RealTimeData type="{data.type}" timestamp="{data.timestamp}" source="{data.source}"/>\n{data.summary}\n</RealTimeData>'
            for data in real_time_data
        ]
    )

    return {"context": [formatted_data]} 
```

This function would retrieve real-time data from various sources, keeping the research up-to-date with the latest information.

## Custom Report Formatting Options

The current implementation produces a standard report format, but we can extend this with custom formatting options for different use cases.

### Executive Summary Format

For business contexts, we could add an executive summary format:

```python
def write_executive_summary(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Write an executive summary of the research """
    
    # Get state
    sections = state["sections"]
    topic = state["topic"]
    
    # Format for executive summary
    system_message = exec_summary_instructions.format(topic=topic, sections=sections)
    
    # Generate executive summary
    exec_summary = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=system_message)]+[HumanMessage(content="Write an executive summary of this research.")])
    
    return {"executive_summary": exec_summary.content}
```

This function would generate a concise executive summary, highlighting key findings and business implications.

### Academic Paper Format

For academic contexts, we could add an academic paper format:

```python
def format_as_academic_paper(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Format the research as an academic paper """
    
    # Get state
    introduction = state["introduction"]
    content = state["content"]
    conclusion = state["conclusion"]
    
    # Generate abstract
    abstract_message = abstract_instructions.format(
        introduction=introduction,
        content=content,
        conclusion=conclusion
    )
    abstract = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=abstract_message)]+[HumanMessage(content="Write an abstract for this paper.")])
    
    # Generate methodology section
    methodology_message = methodology_instructions.format(topic=state["topic"])
    methodology = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=methodology_message)]+[HumanMessage(content="Write a methodology section for this paper.")])
    
    # Assemble academic paper
    academic_paper = f"""# {state.get("title", "Research Paper")}

## Abstract

{abstract.content}

## Introduction

{introduction.strip("# Introduction")}

## Methodology

{methodology.content}

## Findings

{content}

## Conclusion

{conclusion.strip("# Conclusion")}

## References

{state.get("sources", "")}
"""
    
    return {"academic_paper": academic_paper}
```

This function would transform the research into an academic paper format, complete with abstract and methodology sections.

### Interactive Report Format

For digital consumption, we could add an interactive report format:

```python
def create_interactive_report(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Create an interactive version of the report """
    
    # Get state
    sections = state["sections"]
    introduction = state["introduction"]
    conclusion = state["conclusion"]
    
    # Generate interactive elements for each section
    interactive_sections = []
    for section in sections:
        # Extract key points
        key_points_message = key_points_instructions.format(section=section)
        key_points = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=key_points_message)]+[HumanMessage(content="Extract key points from this section.")])
        
        # Generate visualization suggestion
        viz_message = visualization_instructions.format(section=section)
        viz_suggestion = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=viz_message)]+[HumanMessage(content="Suggest a visualization for this section.")])
        
        # Add interactive elements
        interactive_section = {
            "content": section,
            "key_points": key_points.content,
            "visualization": viz_suggestion.content,
            "expandable": True
        }
        interactive_sections.append(interactive_section)
    
    # Assemble interactive report
    interactive_report = {
        "title": state.get("title", "Research Report"),
        "introduction": introduction,
        "sections": interactive_sections,
        "conclusion": conclusion,
        "sources": state.get("sources", ""),
        "interactive_features": ["expandable_sections", "table_of_contents", "search"]
    }
    
    return {"interactive_report": interactive_report}
```

This function would transform the research into an interactive digital format, with expandable sections, key points, and visualization suggestions.

## Interactive Feedback Mechanisms

The current implementation includes a single interruption point for human feedback on analysts, but we can extend this with more interactive feedback mechanisms.

### Progressive Disclosure

We could implement a progressive disclosure approach, where the system reveals information gradually and solicits feedback at multiple points:

```python
# Compile with multiple interruption points
graph = builder.compile(interrupt_before=['human_feedback', 'review_interviews', 'review_draft'])

# Additional nodes for human review
def review_interviews(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ No-op node for human review of interviews """
    pass

def review_draft(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ No-op node for human review of draft report """
    pass

# Conditional edge to continue or modify based on interview review
def process_interview_feedback(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Process feedback on interviews """
    interview_feedback = state.get('interview_feedback', 'approve')
    if interview_feedback.lower() != 'approve':
        # Re-run interviews with feedback
        return "conduct_interview"
    return "write_report"
```

This approach would allow humans to review and provide feedback at multiple stages of the research process, shaping the direction and focus of the research.

### Guided Feedback Collection

We could enhance the feedback process with guided questions that help users provide structured feedback:

```python
def generate_feedback_questions(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Generate structured questions for human feedback """
    
    # Analyze current state to determine appropriate questions
    stage = state.get("current_stage")
    
    if stage == "analysts":
        # Questions about analyst coverage
        questions = [
            "Are there any important perspectives missing from the analyst set?",
            "Do any of the analyst personas seem biased or unbalanced?",
            "Are there specific aspects of the topic you'd like analysts to focus on?"
        ]
    elif stage == "interviews":
        # Questions about interview content
        questions = [
            "Are there important questions that weren't asked in the interviews?",
            "Do any of the expert answers seem inaccurate or unsupported?",
            "Are there specific areas you'd like to see explored in more depth?"
        ]
    elif stage == "draft":
        # Questions about report quality
        questions = [
            "Does the report structure effectively communicate the key insights?",
            "Are there sections that need more development or clarification?",
            "Does the conclusion appropriately synthesize the findings?"
        ]
    else:
        # Default questions
        questions = [
            "What aspects of the current output could be improved?",
            "Are there any errors or issues that need to be addressed?",
            "What additional information would make this more valuable?"
        ]
    
    return {"feedback_questions": questions}
```

This function would generate context-appropriate questions to guide human feedback, making it easier for users to provide constructive input.

### Collaborative Editing

We could implement collaborative editing capabilities, allowing humans to directly modify generated content:

```python
def apply_content_edits(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Apply human edits to generated content """
    
    # Get original and edited content
    original_content = state.get("content", "")
    edited_content = state.get("edited_content", None)
    
    if edited_content:
        # Use edited content instead of original
        content = edited_content
    else:
        # Keep original content
        content = original_content
    
    # Update report with edited content
    report = state.get("report", {})
    report["content"] = content
    
    return {"report": report, "content": content}
```

This function would allow users to edit generated content directly, with the system incorporating these edits into the final output.
