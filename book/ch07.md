# Chapter 7: Section Writing and Report Generation

> "The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe." â€” Gustave Flaubert

The ultimate goal of our research assistant is to generate a comprehensive, well-structured research report. In this chapter, we'll explore how the system transforms the information gathered during interviews into coherent narrative sections and combines these sections into a unified report.

## Technical Writing Prompts and Strategies

At the heart of our report generation process are carefully crafted prompts that guide the LLM in creating high-quality technical writing. Let's examine the key prompts used in this process:

### Section Writer Prompt

After each interview, the system generates a structured report section using this prompt:

```python
section_writer_instructions = """You are an expert technical writer. 
            
Your task is to create a short, easily digestible section of a report based on a set of source documents.

1. Analyze the content of the source documents: 
- The name of each source document is at the start of the document, with the <Document tag.
        
2. Create a report structure using markdown formatting:
- Use ## for the section title
- Use ### for sub-section headers
        
3. Write the report following this structure:
a. Title (## header)
b. Summary (### header)
c. Sources (### header)

4. Make your title engaging based upon the focus area of the analyst: 
{focus}

5. For the summary section:
- Set up summary with general background / context related to the focus area of the analyst
- Emphasize what is novel, interesting, or surprising about insights gathered from the interview
- Create a numbered list of source documents, as you use them
- Do not mention the names of interviewers or experts
- Aim for approximately 400 words maximum
- Use numbered sources in your report (e.g., [1], [2]) based on information from source documents
        
6. In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

### Sources
[1] Link or Document name
[2] Link or Document name

7. Be sure to combine sources. For example this is not correct:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
[4] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

There should be no redundant sources. It should simply be:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
        
8. Final review:
- Ensure the report follows the required structure
- Include no preamble before the title of the report
- Check that all guidelines have been followed"""
```

This prompt emphasizes several key technical writing principles:

1. **Structured Format**: Clear headings and organized content
2. **Audience Focus**: "Easily digestible" content tailored to the analyst's perspective
3. **Conciseness**: 400-word target for maximum impact
4. **Source Attribution**: Proper citation of all information sources
5. **Emphasis on Novelty**: Highlighting surprising or interesting insights

### Report Writer Prompt

Once all sections are generated, the system combines them into a unified report using this prompt:

```python
report_writer_instructions = """You are a technical writer creating a report on this overall topic: 

{topic}
    
You have a team of analysts. Each analyst has done two things: 

1. They conducted an interview with an expert on a specific sub-topic.
2. They write up their finding into a memo.

Your task: 

1. You will be given a collection of memos from your analysts.
2. Think carefully about the insights from each memo.
3. Consolidate these into a crisp overall summary that ties together the central ideas from all of the memos. 
4. Summarize the central points in each memo into a cohesive single narrative.

To format your report:
 
1. Use markdown formatting. 
2. Include no pre-amble for the report.
3. Use no sub-heading. 
4. Start your report with a single title header: ## Insights
5. Do not mention any analyst names in your report.
6. Preserve any citations in the memos, which will be annotated in brackets, for example [1] or [2].
7. Create a final, consolidated list of sources and add to a Sources section with the `## Sources` header.
8. List your sources in order and do not repeat.

[1] Source 1
[2] Source 2

Here are the memos from your analysts to build your report from: 

{context}"""
```

This prompt focuses on synthesis and integration:

1. **Consolidation**: Combining insights from multiple perspectives
2. **Narrative Coherence**: Creating a "cohesive single narrative"
3. **Citation Preservation**: Maintaining proper attribution
4. **Source Consolidation**: Creating a unified source list without duplicates

### Introduction and Conclusion Prompt

Finally, the system generates introduction and conclusion sections using this prompt:

```python
intro_conclusion_instructions = """You are a technical writer finishing a report on {topic}

You will be given all of the sections of the report.

You job is to write a crisp and compelling introduction or conclusion section.

The user will instruct you whether to write the introduction or conclusion.

Include no pre-amble for either section.

Target around 100 words, crisply previewing (for introduction) or recapping (for conclusion) all of the sections of the report.

Use markdown formatting. 

For your introduction, create a compelling title and use the # header for the title.

For your introduction, use ## Introduction as the section header. 

For your conclusion, use ## Conclusion as the section header.

Here are the sections to reflect on for writing: {formatted_str_sections}"""
```

This prompt emphasizes:

1. **Conciseness**: 100-word target for introduction and conclusion
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Previewing or recapping all sections
3. **Compelling Style**: Creating engaging opening and closing sections

These prompts work together to create a cohesive report generation pipeline, from individual sections to unified narrative.

## Structured Section Creation

The section writing process transforms the information gathered during an interview into a structured report section:

```python
def write_section(state: InterviewState):
    """ Node to write a section """

    # Get state
    interview = state["interview"]
    context = state["context"]
    analyst = state["analyst"]
   
    # Write section using either the gathered source docs from interview (context) or the interview itself (interview)
    system_message = section_writer_instructions.format(focus=analyst.description)
    section = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=system_message)]+[HumanMessage(content=f"Use this source to write your section: {context}")]) 
                
    # Append it to state
    return {"sections": [section.content]}

This function takes the retrieved context and the analyst's description as inputs, and generates a structured report section as output. The analyst's description is used to make the section relevant to that analyst's specific perspective.

The resulting section follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
## Engaging Title Related to Analyst's Focus

### Summary
Content that provides background and emphasizes novel insights,
with citations to sources [1] [2] where appropriate.

### Sources
[1] Source 1 URL or document path
[2] Source 2 URL or document path
```

This structured format makes the sections easy to read and ensures proper attribution of information sources.

## Introduction and Conclusion Generation

The introduction and conclusion sections serve as bookends for the report, providing context and closure. They are generated by separate nodes:

```python
def write_introduction(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Node to write the introduction """

    # Full set of sections
    sections = state["sections"]
    topic = state["topic"]

    # Concat all sections together
    formatted_str_sections = "\n\n".join([f"{section}" for section in sections])
    
    # Summarize the sections into a final report
    
    instructions = intro_conclusion_instructions.format(topic=topic, formatted_str_sections=formatted_str_sections)    
    intro = llm.invoke([instructions]+[HumanMessage(content=f"Write the report introduction")]) 
    return {"introduction": intro.content}

def write_conclusion(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Node to write the conclusion """

    # Full set of sections
    sections = state["sections"]
    topic = state["topic"]

    # Concat all sections together
    formatted_str_sections = "\n\n".join([f"{section}" for section in sections])
    
    # Summarize the sections into a final report
    
    instructions = intro_conclusion_instructions.format(topic=topic, formatted_str_sections=formatted_str_sections)    
    conclusion = llm.invoke([instructions]+[HumanMessage(content=f"Write the report conclusion")]) 
    return {"conclusion": conclusion.content}
```

Both functions follow a similar pattern:

1. Take the research topic and all report sections as inputs
2. Concatenate the sections into a single string
3. Generate either an introduction or conclusion based on these inputs

The introduction typically includes:
- An engaging title for the overall report
- A brief overview of the research topic
- A preview of the key findings from each section

The conclusion typically includes:
- A recap of the key findings
- Synthesis of insights across sections
- Potential implications or next steps

Both are kept concise (around 100 words) for maximum impact.

## Flow Control for Section Assembly

The outer graph manages the flow control for section assembly:

```python
builder.add_edge("conduct_interview", "write_report")
builder.add_edge("conduct_interview", "write_introduction")
builder.add_edge("conduct_interview", "write_conclusion")
builder.add_edge(["write_conclusion", "write_report", "write_introduction"], "finalize_report")
```

This graph structure ensures that:

1. All interviews must complete before report writing begins
2. Introduction, body, and conclusion are generated in parallel
3. All three components must complete before final assembly

The parallel generation of introduction, body, and conclusion maximizes efficiency while ensuring that each component has access to all the information it needs.

## Report Compilation

Once all components are ready, the `finalize_report` node assembles them into a cohesive whole:

```python
def finalize_report(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ The is the "reduce" step where we gather all the sections, combine them, and reflect on them to write the intro/conclusion """

    # Save full final report
    content = state["content"]
    if content.startswith("## Insights"):
        content = content.strip("## Insights")
    if "## Sources" in content:
        try:
            content, sources = content.split("\n## Sources\n")
        except:
            sources = None
    else:
        sources = None

    final_report = state["introduction"] + "\n\n---\n\n" + content + "\n\n---\n\n" + state["conclusion"]
    if sources is not None:
        final_report += "\n\n## Sources\n" + sources
    return {"final_report": final_report}
```

This function:

1. Extracts the main content from the report body
2. Separates the content from the sources list (if present)
3. Combines introduction, content, and conclusion with separators
4. Reattaches the sources list to the end of the report

The resulting report has a clean, professional structure:

```
[Introduction with Title]

---

[Main Content]

---

[Conclusion]

## Sources
[Combined source list]
```

This consistent structure makes the report easy to navigate and ensures proper attribution of information sources.

## Report Body Generation

The core content of the report is generated by the `write_report` node:

```python
def write_report(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """ Node to write the final report body """

    # Full set of sections
    sections = state["sections"]
    topic = state["topic"]

    # Concat all sections together
    formatted_str_sections = "\n\n".join([f"{section}" for section in sections])
    
    # Summarize the sections into a final report
    system_message = report_writer_instructions.format(topic=topic, context=formatted_str_sections)    
    report = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=system_message)]+[HumanMessage(content=f"Write a report based upon these memos.")]) 
    return {"content": report.content}
```

This function:

1. Takes all generated sections as input
2. Concatenates them into a single string
3. Generates a cohesive report body that synthesizes their content

The report body focuses on integrating the perspectives from different analysts into a coherent narrative, highlighting common themes and contrasting viewpoints.

## Source Citation Management

Proper citation is a critical aspect of research reporting. Our system manages citations through several mechanisms:

### Individual Section Citations

Each section includes its own source list:

```markdown
### Sources
[1] Source 1 URL or document path
[2] Source 2 URL or document path
```

These citations are specific to the content of that section.

### Consolidated Source List

The report compilation process extracts and consolidates these individual source lists:

```python
if "## Sources" in content:
    try:
        content, sources = content.split("\n## Sources\n")
    except:
        sources = None
else:
    sources = None

final_report = state["introduction"] + "\n\n---\n\n" + content + "\n\n---\n\n" + state["conclusion"]
if sources is not None:
    final_report += "\n\n## Sources\n" + sources
```

This consolidation ensures that all sources are properly credited in the final report.

### Citation Format Standardization

The system prompts include detailed instructions for citation formatting:

```
In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
```

These instructions ensure consistent citation format throughout the report.

### Duplicate Source Detection

The system also includes instructions to avoid duplicate sources:

```
Be sure to combine sources. For example this is not correct:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
[4] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

There should be no redundant sources. It should simply be:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
```

This deduplication ensures that each source is listed only once, even if it's referenced in multiple sections.

## Handling Multi-Analyst Perspectives

One of the key challenges in report generation is integrating perspectives from multiple analysts. The system addresses this challenge through several strategies:

### Perspective-Focused Sections

Each section is generated based on a specific analyst's perspective:

```python
system_message = section_writer_instructions.format(focus=analyst.description)
```

This ensures that each section brings a unique viewpoint to the research topic.

### Synthesis in Report Body

The report body synthesizes these diverse perspectives into a coherent narrative:

```python
system_message = report_writer_instructions.format(topic=topic, context=formatted_str_sections)
```

This synthesis identifies common themes and contrasting viewpoints across analysts.

### Common Framework

Despite diverse perspectives, all sections follow a common structural framework:

```
## Title
### Summary
### Sources
```

This common structure makes it easier to integrate diverse content into a cohesive whole.

## Document Formatting Strategies

The system uses Markdown formatting throughout the report generation process:

```
Use markdown formatting.
Use ## for the section title
Use ### for sub-section headers
```

Markdown is an ideal format for this purpose because:

1. **Simplicity**: Easy to generate and read
2. **Structure**: Clear hierarchical organization
3. **Compatibility**: Widely supported in various platforms
4. **Readability**: Clean, professional appearance even in plain text

The consistent use of Markdown ensures that the final report is well-structured and easy to navigate.

## Report Quality Considerations

The system includes several features to ensure high-quality reports:

### Length Constraints

Both section summaries and introduction/conclusion have target lengths:

```
Aim for approximately 400 words maximum
Target around 100 words
```

These constraints ensure concise, impactful writing without unnecessary verbosity.

### Engagement Focus

The prompts emphasize creating engaging content:

```
Make your title engaging based upon the focus area of the analyst
Emphasize what is novel, interesting, or surprising about insights
```

This focus on engagement helps make the report more compelling for readers.

### Explicit Review Instructions

The section writer prompt includes explicit review instructions:

```
Final review:
- Ensure the report follows the required structure
- Include no preamble before the title of the report
- Check that all guidelines have been followed
```

These instructions encourage the LLM to review and refine its output before submitting.
